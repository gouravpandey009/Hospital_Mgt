- **Objective**: The Hospital Management System in C++ aims to efficiently manage hospital data, including information about hospitals, doctors, and patients.
  
- **Key Functionalities**:
  - Print Hospital Data: Display all hospitals' information.
  - Print Patients Data: Show details of patients.
  - Sort Hospitals by Name: Arrange hospitals alphabetically.
  - Sort Hospitals by Rating: Organize hospitals based on their ratings.
  - Sort by Beds Available: Sort hospitals by the number of available beds.
  - Sort by Beds Price: Arrange hospitals based on minimum bed prices.
  - Print Hospitals in Specific City: Display hospitals located in a specified city.

- **Approach**:
  - **Class Implementation**:
    - Define classes for Hospital and Patient data.
    - Hospital class encapsulates hospital attributes like name, contact details, and doctors.
    - Patient class stores patient-related information.
  - **Data Management**:
    - Utilize arrays to store hospital and patient data.
    - Objects of Hospital and Patient classes are instantiated to access and manipulate the datasets.
  - **Functionality Implementation**:
    - Implement functions like PrintHospitalData(), PrintPatientData(), SortHospitalByName(), SortHospitalByRating(), SortByBedsAvailable(), and SortByBedsPrice() to perform various operations on the hospital dataset.
    - These functions enable viewing hospital and patient information, sorting hospitals based on different criteria, and filtering hospitals by city.

- **Outcome**: The Hospital Management System provides a comprehensive solution for organizing and managing hospital data, catering to the needs of hospital administrators, healthcare professionals, and patients.
